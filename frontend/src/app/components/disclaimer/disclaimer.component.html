  <p i18n><b>ProtecPo Disclaimer:</b> ProtecPo is a tool helping users to select polymer materials for skin protection when
    working with substances. ProtecPo's selection algorithm is based on robust modelling of the interactions between
    substances and polymers, it has been enriched and validated by the addition of physico-chemical and empirical data
    from several sources. <b>Nevertheless, it remains possible that the algorithm may make a selection error.</b>
    ProtecPo's recommendations should be considered as a first step in the selection of polymers, helping to orient
    your choice towards appropriate skin protection. However, they are in no way a substitute for experience with or
    performance tests of your protective materials. ProtecPo does not take the actual conditions where substances and
    protective materials are used into account.</p>

  <p i18n><b>In all cases, you should change your protection immediately upon
    contact with a chemical product, in particular when fine disposable protections are used.</b></p>
