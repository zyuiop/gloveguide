<div class="alert alert-danger" *ngIf="solution.impurities > 15" i18n>
  <mat-icon>error</mat-icon>
  No recommendation can be made because of a too high uncertainty in the composition.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" *ngIf="solution.impurities > 5 && solution.impurities <= 15" i18n>
  <mat-icon>warning</mat-icon>
  The relevance of the recommendation below may be affected by the uncertainty with regard
  to the composition. Thick protections should be favoured. Multi-layer laminated materials, made up of co-polymers,
  also exist.
